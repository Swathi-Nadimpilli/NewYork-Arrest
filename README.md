# NewYork-Arrest
This project explores the huge NYPD Arrest Data dataset, which consists of 112,571 records and 19 variables. By utilising modern techniques, it reveals complex trends in New York City law enforcement operations by looking at arrest records, crime categories, and geographical information. The analysis shows the potential of big data in offering detailed insights about arrest demographics, achieving an impressive 80.41% accuracy in gender prediction by utilising advanced machine learning, notably the Random Forest Classification model. The initiative serves as an example of how data-driven decision-making may create a more informed and equal environment in addition to providing focused counselling.
